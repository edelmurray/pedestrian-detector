# pedestrian-detector
Pedestrian Detector for sample cctv footage.
 Experimented with preprocessing techniques - Gamma correction and Histogram equalisation.
 Feature extraction was carried out using hog(histogram of gradients), pixel concatenation (full image) and dimensionality reduction.
 Experimented with classifiers - SVM, KNN, NN and Random Forests.
 Compared different training/testing splits . Collected metrics for classifiers - F1 rate, Accuracy, False Alarm Rate, Recall Rate, Error Rate, Precision and Specificity.
 Used metrics to decide on classifier to use for detection. 
 Plotted bounding boxes on jpegs from cctv footage, to check for correct detection.
